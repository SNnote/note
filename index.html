<hr>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;width: 40em;">The journey of attaining “RN” at the end of our name does not pass by on a royal road or a calm, splendid sea. In fact, it is a challenging journey, but at the end, it is a waiting paradise of hope and opportunities. <br> The following are the phases that I created based on my observation and perception regarding the voyage of a student nurse towards her dream and navigation of purpose.</p> 
<ol style="font-size:20px; background-color: rgba(285, 263, 138, .5);"> 1. Naïve Phase</ol>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;text-align:justify;width: 60em; ">Being qualified to be part of the nursing community feels surreal. Some people, including me, are overwhelmed with gratitude, especially if the admissions process was tough. These feelings ignite an aspiring individual to start their nursing journey with optimism. It is imperative that once you enter nursing school, you bear in mind the responsibilities that you are accountable for, as well as prepare yourself for what is called “expect the unexpected." This phase is somehow entering nursing school like an empty vessel. Unfamiliar with anatomy and physiology, medical terms and abbreviations, drug calculations, medical procedures, and so much more. Hence, an optimistic attitude is needed to create a good foundation where the first drops of knowledge, skills, and experiences will fill in the empty vessel.</p>
<ol style="font-size:20px; background-color: rgba(285, 263, 138, .5);"> 2. Awareness Phase</ol>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;text-align:justify;width: 60em ">Gradually realizing what to deal with in nursing endeavors. Here, essential lessons and procedures are starting to be learned and demonstrated, respectively. It is significantly challenging, especially since you need to adjust your time, focus, and priorities. Investing quality time and effort in navigating the ocean of knowledge and improvement is surely a great help that you could give to yourself. It won’t be easy, but it will be worth it.</p>
<ol style="font-size:20px; background-color: rgba(285, 263, 138, .5);"> 3. Acceptance Phase</ol>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;text-align:justify;width: 60em ">An enlightenment that will tell you that no matter how difficult it is, your love for nursing will not fade. You will be challenged uncountable times, yet you should still muster the courage to stand up and continue the fight. As time passes, the level of difficulty increases, and you become more accountable. You will be exposed to serious situations that will test your grip on your dream; however, you must be firm in your decision; there is no turning back. As they say, if you fall off a cliff, you can climb up again. Always remember the reasons why you chose this path.</p>
<ol style="font-size:20px; background-color: rgba(285, 263, 138, .5);"> 4. Internalization phase</ol>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:left;text-align:justify;width: 60em ">The empty vessel is now almost full. Equipped with the knowledge, skills, and attitude that are essential in the field. This phase is more about embracing the role as if nursing were indeed crafted for you. Everything is just natural. Moreover, passion is clearly evident in providing quality care molded with experience.<br>It is the peak to which I personally look forward as a student nurse. Surely, there is still more to be discovered in this phase as I move forward and unfold the remaining pages of my nursing life story.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;width: 40em;">There may be storms along the way. Stocked between taking a detour or a brave drive, You may doubt if you’re taking the right path, but hopefully you will choose what your heart says. Fight for your dreams. Be a nurse. Bring hope to others.</p>
